    <!-- Basic information -->
    <div class="text"> This is the transport page where you can find information about Kongsberg's two different public transortation methodes: Busses and Trains.
    </div>
    <!-- Busses -->
    <div class="texttitle">
        <a href="https://brakar.no/" class="selecting">Busses</a>
    </div>    
    <div class="text">The busses in Kongsberg resemble the country's commitment to sustainability and technological advancement by having electric/hybrid busses, also implementing features such as onboard Wi-Fi and real time information about their routes. Kongsberg has a network of several buss routes that connect the city to various locations within Kongsberg (Mostly starting from the buss station called Knutepunkt), its neigboring areas and even farther cities such as Oslo. Kongsberg does not have autonomous busses yet such as Drammen but people at the Technology Park are working on it. There is a picture below to show the buss routes within Kongsberg. The dotted lines mean that the busses are only avaliable at morning and evening rush hours. For even more information such as exact routes, times, prices, etc. click on the tittle of this paragraph or for another link here: <a href="https://www.vy.no/en/traffic-and-routes/times" class="selecting">Second link</a></div>

    <!-- Trains -->
    <div class="texttitle">
        <a href="https://vy.no/" class="selecting">Trains</a>
    </div>
    <div class="text">The trains are also a great way to travel outside of Kongsberg. The only stop in Kongsberg is the train station (Kongsberg stasjon). From here, you can get a route for most of the bigger cities in the vicinity such as Drammen, Oslo and even Bergen. There are a few stops for smaller cities such as Eidsvoll, but they are stops only because bigger cities are nearby. Trains usually go each hour, but for some the waiting time is longer. They offer everything a traveler might need to enjoy their train journey from WiFi and electric outlets by the seats, to meal and snacks provided during the trip.</div>
